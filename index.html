        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Your Name, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating visually appealing and functional websites. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            With experience in front-end development, I have worked on various projects that involve creating responsive and interactive web applications. My skill set includes:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML & CSS: Building responsive and accessible web pages</li>
                <li>JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic content</li>
                <li>Version Control: Using Git for managing code</li>
                <li>Design: Crafting user-friendly interfaces with a keen eye for detail</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Currently, I am delving deeper into modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to enhance my development capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest web design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book on technology and innovation. I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and work on projects that make a positive impact.

            <h3>Responsive Landing Page</h3>
            <p>
                A landing page, also referred to as a lead capture page, static page, or destination page, serves a specific purpose and typically appears as a result of online advertising or search engine optimization efforts. Unlike a homepage, a landing page is stripped of distractions and focuses on capturing visitor information through a form, while reassuring them that the website can address their needs. In this article, we are going to create a landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe web Application</h3>
            <p>
                I will create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript. I will be using validation checks to implement the game features. The UI is designed using CSS so it is easy to create. In the game, Player-1 starts playing the game and both players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.
